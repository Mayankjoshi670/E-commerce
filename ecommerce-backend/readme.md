in controllers FOlder 
// app.get("/users" , (req , res):any=>{
// res.send("sneding data");
// })
// Or we can do this 
// const controlerA = (req , res)=>{
//     res.send("sending data");
// }
// app.get("/users" , controlerA)
//  these controler are in controler folder 


in models folder we write schemas 
 middleWares  you know you know 
 all handlers we need to use let say any one directly want to log in into admin page he cant because he will go at fist this middlewares and check weather it is verified user or not 

 as we know that we are using typescript 
 so we need to define types so all types are in type folder 

 in utils folder we have 
 all feature  we need to use again and again (let say we need to find average which takes array and return average we make a util of it )
